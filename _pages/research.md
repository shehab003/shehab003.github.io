Protein Succinylation Site Prediction
--------
Protein post-translational modifications (PTM) are important cellular regulatory processes that occur after protein synthesis. Protein PTMs have been detected by a variety of experimental techniques. Generally, the experimental analysis of PTMs requires time-consuming, labor and capital-intensive techniques and the use of hazardous/expensive chemical reagents. <b>Succinylation</b>, a special type of PTM, involves the transfer of a succinyl group to a protein molecule at its lysine (K) residue. Succinylation plays an important role in the growth and development of plants and is very dynamic under different cellular conditions. In our study, we define a context window for each lysine residue containing its neighboring amino acid residues and apply state-of-the-art NLP models to classify the lysine residue as succinylated or non-succinylated. We also apply meta heuristics to find out optimum set of amino acid indices to achieve better accuracy. We have compared our work with the state-of-the art work by using the PLMD dataset and found comparable results with significantly less computational cost. We are now working on further improvement of our experimental result.<br/>

Hierarchical Attention for Host Intrusion Detection
--------
The host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) has been gaining attention in the community of cybersecurity for over two decades. Compared with the network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS), HIDS has the superiorities of fine granularity and the ability to detect internal attacks. In our work, we propose a novel hierarchical attention based deep learning method to detect intrusion on a host. We evaluate our model on ADFA-LD dataset, which is a collection of Linux system calls’ traces. We have tuned our model’s hyper parameters to gain higher sensitivity as well as lower false alarm rate comparedto other relevant state-of-the-art works.<br/>
