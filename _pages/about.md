I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Enginerring (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 

Earlier I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the same university I am serving now.

Research Experience
------
During my M.Sc. Thesis and most of my academic career, I have worked on <b>big data analytics</b>, <b>cloud computing</b>, and <b>distributed systems</b>. In my M.Sc. Thesis, I worked on deriving a scalable and federated technique of PCA which is applicable on any arbitrarily large dimensional datasets. I would like to highlight that, an article titled <b>Fast, scalable and geo-distributed PCA for big data analytics</b>, based on my M.Sc. Thesis has been published in the Elsevier Journal <b>Information Systems</b> in the 98th volume of May 2021. 

I also have experience of working on large scale social media data analytics and a manuscript titled <b>UACD: A Local Approach for Identifying the Most Influential Spreaders in Twitter in a Distributed Environment</b> is currently under review at the <b>Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM)</b> journal. In this work, I have derived a local algorithm of identifying the most influential spreaders on the Twitter social network using our own designed user attributed code decomposition (UACD) method which provably can achieve the efficiency of a global algorithm with the reduced running time complexity (on an average <b>175x reduction than global algorithms</b>) similar to a local algorithm. Our derived method has been empirically manifested to be effective in large scale social graph analysis on a distributed platform.  

In addition, I also have explored some other fields such as <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Network security</b>, and <b>Bioinformatics</b>. For example, in the case of network security, I have designed a model with <b>hierarchical attention</b> for the host intrusion detection system (<b>HIDS</b>). In bioinformatics, I proposed a novel multi-layer convolutional network for <b>protein function prediction</b>. The manuscripts for both projects are close to completion.

Research Interest
------
My primary research interest is Data Mining, Big Data Analytics, Social Media Data Anlytics, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, and Federated Learning. However, I am highly interested in other fileds such as Deep Learning, Bioinformatics, and Network Security.
