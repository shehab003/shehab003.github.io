I am working as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Enginerring (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 

I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the same university in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the same university.

Research Experience
------
During my B.Sc. Thesis and most of my academic career, I have worked on applying Machine Learning on <b>Bioinformatics</b>. In my B.Sc. Thesis, we worked on characterizing <b>Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs)</b> using protein sequence annotations of functional sites and regions available in the UniProt knowledgebase. We identified 8 out of 25 features to be enriched in IDRs. We also observed that some IDRs are more tolerant to missense mutations than synonymous mutations. We applied machine learning to demonstrate that mutation-intolerant IDRs carry a distinct signature of functional features. Our work is currently under review in the <b>PLOS Computational Biology</b>.

Currently, I am working on predicting succinylated lysine residues in the PLMD dataset. I am exploring different state-of-the-art NLP models to classify a residue as succinylated or non-succinylated based on the surrounding amino acids of the concerned lysine residue. I have been able to produce comparable result with the current state-of-the-art work with significantly less computational cost. I am now working on improving my model's performance.

I have also worked on Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) as part of <b>Network Security</b> course project during my M.Sc. I have built a hierarchical attention model which can differentiate malicious from benign programs by analyzing the system calls the program has used. The model is now being fine tuned to produce optimum result. During doing this project, I grew interest in the field of Network Security and NLP.

Research Interest

My primary research interest is Network Security, NLP, and Bioinformatics.
